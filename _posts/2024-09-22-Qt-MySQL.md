## <span style="color: blue;">Connecting MySQL to Qt6</span>

My recent Project involves two mainly used tools: Qt6 and MySQL. As the document says, Qt provides a module Qt SQL for communicate with different database APIs. Qt SQL module uses so called **driver plugins** to achieve this. However, Qt6 does not support all those database by default. Some of the database-specific drivers must be built on your own. This Blog will discuss serveral problems that I've encountered during the process of connecting MySQL to Qt6. 

Especially for problems like this:
![mysql_qt6_connection]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mysql_qt6_connection.PNG)

The driver is built and loaded, but cannot be recognized under debug environment.

> Check the supported drivers in Qt6

1. First thing is to check, <span style="color: blue;">which databases are supported in Qt6 by default</span>. As the desired DB is MySQL, Let's check whether the MySQL driver is available.

In the qmake file, the sql module should be added.
```qmake
QT += sql
```
In the cmake file, the sql package should be included.
```Cmakelist
find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Sql)
target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE Qt6::Sql)
```
In the source file, we can check the available drivers through the following code.
```cpp
#include <QSqlDatabase> // to use SQL module, this head file must be included
...
qDebug() <<  QSqlDatabase::drivers(); // print out all available drivers
...
```
The output by default is:
```
QList("QSQLITE", "QMIMER", "QMARIADB")
```

Clearly, we can see our desired DB is not included, we need to build the driver on our own. 

This Blog https://github.com/thecodemonkey86/qt_mysql_driver and the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YIJUL9pz2U&ab_channel=QtWithKetan help me a lot.

By following the steps in this video we can easily build the driver in Qt6. 

However, after the installation, my MySQL driver was not detected. The output is like:
![mysql_qt6_connection]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mysql_qt6_connection.PNG)

By adding the ```QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1``` into the Build Environment in project setting. So that I could track the project build process. 

It is said that, the ```$MYSQLDIR/lib/libmysql.dll``` is not in the **PATH**, to fix this, simply copy the ```libmysql.dll``` to  the application directory(in the same directory with the .exe file): Mine is ```D:\Qt\Projectname\build\Desktop_Qt_6_7_2_MinGW_64_bit-Debug\debug```

Someone else has reported about this problem, as descripted in https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/51137-SOLVED-How-to-use-MySQL-in-Qt-plugin-not-recognized-quot-module-could-not-be-found-quot
